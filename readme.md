## Beer Inventory System
The keg inventory system is designed to address the issue of managing the location, volume, and aging of the beer. Breweries must account for every ounce of beer that they produce and file reports with the state. Currently this is handled by a manual record keeping or in some cases a spreadsheet. The keg inventory system will allow for efficiencies to be gained in the documentation of the keg inventory within a brewery. The system will house data such as the different keg sizes, the type of beer with high level attributes, and the location of the keg. All kegs must have a bib on them to identify the beer, this system will help create the bib and allow for scanning by a mobile device to check in and check out the keg from inventory when selling them to restaurants or customers. The reporting aspect will bring provide the most value in terms of being able to see the inventory at a glance and the location. Kegs are expensive and having kegs lying around or sitting empty at another location is money lost. The keg inventory system will allow breweries to effectively plan and manage their inventory to maximize revenue. 

## Enterprise Focus
While the keg inventory system focuses on one aspect of the brewery, the database will support the reports that are required to submit to the state regarding the amount of beer brewed each month. Interfaces to other support systems within the business such as the point of sale system and accounting system could be explored to determine value. The keg inventory system is not designed for one particular brewery rather it could be sold to any brewery around the world.

## Development Infrastructure
We utilized a LAMP server stack via Amazon Web Services for our development infrastructure. The project follows MVC design pattern and is based on the Laravel framework. It also uses Web 2.0 techniques like AJAX and JavaScript frameworks like JQuery to provide CRUD functionality and user management.

## Technologies Used
Laravel, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML5, CSS3

## Official Documentation
Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
